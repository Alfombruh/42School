# Which OS install on the VM, Debian or CentOS?

In Born2beroot, you have to choose between two OS for the virtual machine: CentOS or Debian. Both are GNU/LINUX distributions, created by the community and open source. In addition to being focused on being stable and safe.

# About CentOS
CentOS (**C**ommunity **ENT**erprise **O**perating **S**ystem) was a RHEL-based operating system (**R**ed **H**at **E**nterprise **L**inux, created by the Red Hat company) created by the community since 2004, being sponsored by the Red Hat company itself in 2014 until being discontinued by it in 2020 in favor of CentOS Stream, this has done that the CentOS community created new variants of this OS such as Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux. CentOS, being a clone of RHEL, is binary and functionally compatible with it, which gives the user a free alternative of similar quality to RHEL, being equally robust, stable and easy to install and use.

As for this practice the option is CentOS and in 2024 its latest updates will end, I have decided to install Debian, as it is also an operating system that I know and handle better.

# About Debian
Launched in 1993, Debian has become one of the best-known GNU/Linux OSes, being the basis for others such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint or PureOS. Thought to be the most stable system possible, it is supported by one of the largest free software communities which has allowed Debian to have a large selection of packages and to be installed on many architectures. On the contrary, its management becomes somewhat complicated at the beginning for new users (you have to use the terminal a lot) and it does not have a business version such as CentOS.
