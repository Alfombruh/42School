# What is UFW?
For a long time, Linux security was in the hands of *iptables* (which works with the underlying *netfilter* system). Although incredibly powerful, iptables are tricky, especially for newer users. To get the most out of that system, it can take weeks or months to get up to speed. Fortunately, there is UFW (**U**ncomplicated **F**ire**w**all) a much simpler interface to iptables that provides a much easier to use framework for managing netfilter and a command line interface to work with the firewall.

[Here](https://wiki.debian.org/Uncomplicated%20Firewall%20%28ufw%29) I leave you a small guide on how to use.

## What is a firewall?
A firewall is a network security device that monitors network traffic (incoming and outgoing) and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

Firewalls have been a first line of defense in network security for more than 25 years. They establish a barrier between protected and controlled internal networks that can be trusted and external networks that are not trusted, such as the Internet.

A firewall can be hardware, software, or both.
